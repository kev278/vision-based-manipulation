vbmbot_joint_controller.py - launches with vb_joint_vel_and_pos_pub.launch

Run this project by launching the following - 
`roslaunch vision_based_manipulation vb_publish_joint_pose_and_vel.launch`
-- When node is initialized, the robot is in home position as send by the launch file. the position controller publishes a target joint position that moves the arm from home position, then ros switches controller to publish random joint velocity to move the arm randomly
